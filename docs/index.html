            <!-- Add more content -->
            I am currently a final year PhD Student at Cardiff University where I am supervised by Dr Timothy Davis and Dr Ilaria Ruffa. My research focues on studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and how they interact with there host galaxies. I utilise observational data from telescopes such as ALMA to study AGN fuelling and feedback in galaxies. I also study the emission from AGN to try and understand the underlying accretion mechanism. 

I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Portsmouth and then stayed in Portsmouth to complete a Masters in Research

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            I am involved in a number of projects where I am trying to understand AGN. Firstly, I am involved in the WISDOM project which has gathered high resolution CO data for a number of nearby active galaxies. I have been utilising this data to study the connection between the molecular gas in these galaxies and the activity from the AGN to see how the molecular gas can be fuelling the AGN and how the AGN can impact the structure of the surrounding gas.
