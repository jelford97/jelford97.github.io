My name is Jacob Elford. I am a 3rd year astrophysics PhD student at Cardiff University working with Dr Timothy Davis and Dr Ilaria Ruffa. I am currently studying active galactic nuclei (AGN). More specifically I study how the properties of AGN correlate with the properties of the host galaxies. I also study AGN at multiple wavelengths to see how the emission from AGN at different wavelengths correlate with each other to try and understand the underlying accretion process.
